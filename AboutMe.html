    <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
    <p data-testid="test-about-confidence">
      I am an introvert first and foremost so I struggle with talking with people
      and social media in general. I also suffer from low self esteem and anxiety
      due to past trauma which I am working on. I also do not have the same level
      of experience as some of my peers which makes me feel like I am behind at times
